# Changelog

All notable changes to EasyApplyMax will be documented in this file.

## [v1.5.0] - 2026-01-15

### ✨ New Features
- **LinkedIn Collections Support** - Now works on `/jobs/collections/` pages (saved jobs, recommended jobs, etc.) with infinite scroll
- **Smart Resume Selection** - Now selects existing/previously uploaded CV instead of re-uploading for each application. Only uploads once (first application), then reuses the CV.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Removed redundant "Welcome aboard!" toast message after onboarding
- Fixed fadeOut animation for onboarding overlay closure
- Fixed resume being uploaded for every single application (now uploads once, then selects existing)

### 🔧 Technical Improvements
- Collections support uses conditional selectors (only on collections pages, doesn't affect search pages)
- Infinite scroll pagination for collections pages
- Standard pagination preserved for search pages
