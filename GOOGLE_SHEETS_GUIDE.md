### Data Structure
Your Google Sheet will contain:

## 🛠️ How It Will Work (Technical)

### 1. One-Time Setup
1. **Enable Google Sheets API**
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a project
   - Enable Google Sheets API
   - Get API credentials

2. **Authorize Extension**
   - Click "Connect Google Sheets" in EasyApplyMax
   - Sign in with Google
   - Grant permissions

3. **Create/Select Sheet**
   - Create new sheet automatically
   - Or connect to existing sheet

### 2. Automatic Sync
Once setup:
- Every application → New row in Google Sheets
- Real-time updates (or batched based on preference)
- Offline support (queue & sync when online)

---

## 🔐 Privacy & Security

- ✅ Uses OAuth 2.0 (secure Google authentication)
- ✅ Only accesses YOUR sheets (not others')
- ✅ Can revoke access anytime
- ✅ Data encrypted in transit
- ✅ No third-party servers (direct to Google)

---

## 📝 Manual Workaround (Current)

While we build the automatic integration, here's a manual workflow:

### Step 1: Export CSV
1. Open EasyApplyMax extension
2. Go to "Applied Jobs" tab
3. Click "Export Applied Jobs (CSV)"
4. Save the CSV file

### Step 2: Import to Google Sheets
1. Open [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com/)
2. Create new sheet (or open existing)
3. File → Import → Upload
4. Select your CSV file
5. Choose "Append to current sheet" (to keep history)

### Step 3: Create Analytics (Optional)
Add charts and formulas:

```
// Applications per day
=QUERY(A2:D, "SELECT A, COUNT(A) GROUP BY A")

// Top companies
=QUERY(C2:C, "SELECT C, COUNT(C) GROUP BY C ORDER BY COUNT(C) DESC")

// Response rate (if you track responses)
=COUNTIF(E:E, "Response") / COUNTA(A:A) * 100
```
